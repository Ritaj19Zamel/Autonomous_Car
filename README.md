# Autonomous System For Car
## Goal 

The goal of this project is to develop an autonomous car system that can detect and respond to various traffic situations in real-time. The system will be equipped with advanced features such as object detection, Autonomous Lane Navigation, license plate recognition, Road defect detection, Graph Traffic Prediction Graph, RainForcment Driven and Parking rainforcment.

- Object Detection:
> The system will use various sensors such as cameras and LIDAR to detect traffic signs, traffic lights, pedestrians, and other objects on the road. The system will use state-of-the-art object detection algorithms such as YOLOv7 to accurately detect and classify these objects.

- Autonomous Lane Navigation:
> The system will use computer vision and control algorithms to navigate the car on the road. It will be able to detect the lane markings and stay within the boundaries of the lane.

- Road Defect Detection:
> The system will be able to detect and report the defects on the road such as potholes, cracks, and other road surface issues. This information can be used to improve road maintenance and safety for all road users.

- Graph Traffic Prediction:
> The system will use traffic data and machine learning algorithms to predict traffic patterns and congestion levels. This information can be used to optimize routing and improve the efficiency of traffic flow.

- ReinForcment Driven
> The system will be able to detect and respond to different weather conditions, such as rain, by adjusting the car's speed and handling accordingly to ensure the safety of the vehicle and its passengers.
